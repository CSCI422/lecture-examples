      Course Information This course talks about the design of digital
      interfaces, with key concepts such as responsiveness, accessibility, and
      user-centered design. Students will learn how to create design mockups in
      Figma, test designs with users, apply effective UI and UX focused
      feedback, communicate effectively with stakeholders and users, and more.
      Students will be taught the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but
      extensive prior programming experience is not expected or required. Dr.
      Rob Thompson is the lead instructor for this course and teaches a sister
      course, Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) every spring. Rob also often
      teaches CSCI128 and CSCI306. Ethan Richards is a masters student in
      Computer Science and was the original designer and now TA-lecturer for the
      course.
